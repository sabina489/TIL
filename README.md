### Listing branches 

â€‹                        **Goal**                                                            **Command**

### Today, I learned about pull request in GitHub.

*Pull requests let us tell others about changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository on Git-Hub* .

## Nov 19, 2021

### *Today, I learned about variables, numbers, strings in Python.*

**1. Variables**

*To create a variable in Python, all we need to do is specify the variable name, and then assign a value to it.*

```
<variable name> = <value>
```

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
* A variable name cannot start with a number.
* A variable name only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.
* Variable names are case-sensitive.

*Today, I learned about Inheritance in Python.*

* *Python Inheritance* : Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

* Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

* Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

  *We use a Is-A when we talk about objects and classes being related to each other by a class relationship.*

  *We use a Has-A when we talk about objects and classes that are related only because they reference each other.*
