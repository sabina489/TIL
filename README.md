- git add  **<file>**                                             *//Add Files to Index*
- *git status*                                                          *//Check Status of Working Tree*
- *git commit*  *-m "Initial commit"*                      *//Commit Changes in Index*
- *git remote*  *-v*                                                     *//Adding a remote*

> Hence, different git operations were learned and got familiar on writing TIL.
