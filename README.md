## Nov 16, 2021

### Today, I learned about git.

### Basic Commands

- *git init*                                         //Initialize Local Git Repository

- git add  **<file>**                      *//Add Files to Index*
- *git status*                                   *//Check Status of Working Tree*
- *git commit*                               *//Commit Changes in Index*
- *git push*                                  *//Push to Remote Repository*
- *git clone*                                  // Clone Repository into a New Directory 

*I learned how to connect to git-hub with ssh key.*

> Hence, different git operations were learned and got familiar on writing TIL.
